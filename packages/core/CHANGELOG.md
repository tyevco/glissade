## 0.9.0-pre.1

### Patch Changes

- f3b471b: Hardening from the in-house 0.9 canary (all confined to the opt-in studio-host / strict-font surfaces; the determinism gate was clean):

  - **Undo is now byte-exact even on un-normalized sidecars.** The snapshot-restore inverse is a `verbatim` setTrackKeys that replays the prior state as-is, instead of re-running `normalizeEditedKeys` (which re-pinned spring keys / re-nudged collisions and silently mutated the curve on externally-sourced or `setSidecarTrack`-written sidecars).
  - **`parseCmap` can't hang on a corrupt font.** The format-12 group count is clamped to what the buffer holds — a truncated subtable that declared billions of groups (a ~30s stall on the `--strict` font path) now returns empty instantly.
  - **The editable-host rule is enforced on the write surface.** `applyPatches` (setTrackKeys/addKey) and `setSidecarTrack` now reject structural `~Type.ordinal` / empty-nodeId targets, so a low-level consumer can't persist a sidecar track that then crashes `evaluate()`.
  - **Reserved-id guard at construction.** A node id in the reserved `~` namespace throws `ReservedNodeIdError` at `createScene` (was accepted, then failed confusingly at the first tween).
  - **Undo of a baseline-seeded first edit** restores `{timelines:{}}` exactly (prunes the timeline only when the transaction created it), instead of leaving an empty `{tracks:{}}` shell.

## 0.9.0-pre.0

### Minor Changes

- 04a1059: feat(fonts): FontRegistry + strict-mode font validation + cmap glyph coverage (§3.6)

  Explicit fonts grow up. `AssetRef` gains optional `faces` (weight/style variants)
  and `fallback` (the family chain) — purely additive: a bare `{ kind: 'font', url }`
  stays the single 400/normal face with a `[family]` chain, so every existing
  document renders byte-identically.

  New in `@glissade/core` (DEV/export-path only, never in `evaluate()`, tree-shaken
  from real embeds):

  - `buildFontRegistry(assets)` → `FontRegistry` with `has`, `faces()`,
    `resolveFace(family, weight, style)` (CSS nearest-weight), and
    `fallbackChain(family)`.
  - `parseCmap(bytes)` — a pure, zero-dep sfnt `cmap` reader (formats 4 + 12)
    returning the covered code points; malformed input yields an empty set.
  - `validateFonts(usages, registry, cmaps, mode)` + `FontValidationError` —
    reports unregistered non-generic families and uncovered glyphs (the
    "héllo 👋 renders emoji in Chrome, tofu in Skia" bug). Generic and
    caller-supplied OS families are exempt, so a default-font Text never errors.

  New in `@glissade/scene`: `collectTextUsages(scene)`, `validateSceneFonts(scene,
doc, loadBytes, opts)` (node-walk + caller I/O → core validation), and
  `TextProps.fontStyle: 'normal' | 'italic'` threaded into `FontSpec` (omitted when
  normal, so goldens are unchanged).

  Strict-vs-dev is a per-render/per-export OPTION (default dev-warn), never a
  Timeline flag: `exportVideo({ strictFonts })`, `gs render --strict`, and a
  `mount({ strictFonts })` option. All three loaders now register EVERY declared
  face (not one-per-asset): export-web awaits each face before frame 0, the CLI
  registers each path via `GlobalFonts`, the player loads non-awaited.

- 7edd807: feat(core): studio edit-gating + write-back helpers (§6.2)

  Adds the core surface the studio needs to gate GUI edits and offer the
  hybrid write-back affordances (the `isEditableNodeId` predicate ships
  separately):

  - `editableDuration()` on `TimelineBuilder` + `isDurationEditable(doc)` — opt
    the (otherwise code-owned) timeline duration into studio editing, mirroring
    `.editable()` for tracks. Backed by an additive optional
    `Timeline.editableDuration` field; existing documents are unaffected.
  - `deleteSidecarTrack(doc, timelineId, target)` — remove one editor-owned
    track from the sidecar (§6.2 rule 7 "extract edits to code"), returning a new
    document and never mutating the input. Source is never touched.

  All additive; no existing document changes shape or renders differently.

- ea9657c: Studio foundation (DESIGN §6.3/§6.4), the core half of the StudioHost work: a new tree-shaken entry **`@glissade/core/studio-host`** exporting the `StudioHost` interface types (`MergedTimeline = Timeline & { orphans }`, `NodeDescriptor`, `SignalPath`, `StudioEvent`), the `isEditableNodeId` rule (only explicit, non-structural ids host editable tracks), and the **`TimelinePatch` engine**: `applyPatches(doc, patches, baseline?)` applies a fine-grained, by-stable-key-id edit transaction **atomically** (an invalid patch rejects the whole batch, doc untouched) and returns a snapshot-restore **inverse** for undo that round-trips byte-for-byte — even through `normalizeEditedKeys`' spring re-pin. Every patch variant is plain JSON (structured-clone-safe for a future postMessage host). Kept entirely out of the embed `.` bundle. (The studio's in-process host + App.tsx rewire onto this land next.)

### Patch Changes

- 7035c6b: Enforce the editable-host rule on track targets (§6.4/§6.5, the structural-id guards): a structural `~Type.ordinal` string target is now rejected at track creation (`UnresolvableTargetError` — structural ids are inspection-only, never track targets), and `.editable()` on a target lacking an explicit node id throws a clear `TimelineValidationError`. Both share the single `isEditableNodeId` predicate, now exported from core (alongside `targetNodeId`) and consumed by the builder, the scene, and the studio host. (The `~Type.ordinal` structural-id _generator_ was dropped per the 0.9 design lock; only the guards remain.)

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- 1d56c0a: Composer cue signaling (the ad-break feature). Author cues on the builder: `tl.cue(at, name, data?)` and `tl.adBreak(at, { id, duration })` emit serialized `Marker`s (an ad-break carries `data.kind: 'ad-break'`). At runtime `player.onCue(kind, cb)` fires for any cue of that kind on forward crossing (sugar over `onMarker`). At render, `gs render` writes a deterministic `<stem>.cues.json` (`{ t, kind, name, duration }`) next to the output whenever cue markers exist, plus `--chapters vtt` for a WebVTT chapters file — so a downstream NLE / ad-insertion pipeline has machine-readable break points. Rides the existing pure marker substrate; no new evaluation surface.
- 8820f3f: Reshape the editor sidecar to `sidecarVersion: 2` (§6.2) — the foundation for safe code↔editor round-tripping. Edits are now namespaced by timeline id (`'main'` for the linear timeline; v2 machines add more), tracks are keyed by canonical target and carry the code `baseHash` they branched from, keys get stable `k<N>` ids, and tracks whose target drifted are parked as `orphans` (with a reason) instead of failing to bind the whole overlay. New core API: `migrateSidecar` (lifts v1 documents forward on load), `setSidecarTrack` (the studio write path, assigns key ids + baseHash), `mergeSidecarDetailed` (returns the bindable timeline + drift list + orphans), `hashKeys`, `assignKeyIds`. `mergeSidecar` keeps returning a bindable `Timeline` and now accepts v1 or v2 input. The studio and vite-plugin read/write v2 (v1 files migrate automatically). The drift-badge / orphan-relink studio UI is a follow-up.
- bc15866: Registry & schema completeness (§2.2/§4.7/§B.6):
  - `ValueType` gains optional `serialize`/`deserialize` (default identity for JSON-native types), so a custom value type can round-trip through the Timeline document.
  - New registered `vec2-arc` value type: interpolates a vec2 along a circular arc (polar lerp of radius + shortest-path angle) instead of a straight chord.
  - Reserved schema slots accepted (but inert) in v1 so v2 needs no migration: `Key.from: 'live'` (the §4.7 synthesized-transition sentinel) and `Track.additive` (the §B.6 blending flag — v1 stays last-wins).

### Patch Changes

- dac15c9: Cue→chapters polish (downstream validation follow-ups on the 0.8 ad-break feature):

  - **Plain `cue()` now serializes.** `cue(at, name, data?)` stamps `data.kind: 'cue'` by default (a caller-supplied `kind` still wins), so a cue authored without an explicit kind now lands in `cues.json` and fires `player.onCue('cue', …)` instead of being silently dropped. The `data.kind` gate that excludes `.call()`/label markers stays intact.
  - **`--chapters vtt` shows the human title, not the kind.** The WebVTT cue text is now `data.title ?? name` (was the machine `kind`), and a `00:00` "Intro" chapter is auto-anchored when the earliest cue starts later — making the output a drop-in for a YouTube description chapter block (YouTube reads the cue text as the title and requires a 0:00 start). `cues.json` is unchanged (keeps `kind` for machines) and stays byte-deterministic.

- bc75e7c: `mergeSidecar` now re-resolves `derived:true` leading keys against the merged track (§2.6): a derived from-key duplicates the preceding key's held value, so an upstream edit (a sidecar that bumped the prior key) flows into it instead of leaving a stale value that pops at the segment start. Build-time derived keys are already correct; this only touches the ones an edit moved beneath.

## 0.7.0

### Patch Changes

- 0c0a583: A/V sync offsets are now sample-accurate and identical across export paths by construction (§5.3). A new `audioOffsetSamples(at, sampleRate)` in core (`round(at * sampleRate)`) is the single source of truth: the CLI mixer derives its `adelay` from the sample grid instead of rounding to milliseconds, and the browser `OfflineAudioContext` mixer snaps clip starts (and gain-envelope times) to the same grid instead of using raw float seconds. Previously the two paths could drift sub-frame and a non-frame-aligned `at` passed through silently.
- 0848530: `sampleTrack` now emits a once-per-track dev warning when a non-extrapolating type (path / discrete) clamps an out-of-range eased value — e.g. a spring or overshooting ease on a `path` track gets flattened. Previously the clamp was silent, hiding a likely authoring mistake.
- 0848530: `validateTrack` now canonicalizes non-hold keys on discrete (`string` / `boolean`) tracks to explicit holds. These types are hold-only by construction (their `lerp` already snaps), so this is behaviorally a no-op — but it makes the serialized document honest and stops a curve editor from offering a meaningless ease on a discrete track.
- 0848530: Pin the custom-ease numeric derivative fallback step to `h = 1/1024` (§B.5). Eases lacking a closed-form derivative now read velocity via a spec-fixed symmetric-difference step, so interruption handoffs are reproducible across JS engines instead of depending on an arbitrary `1e-5`.
- 25c5986: Sidecar label merge precedence is fixed: **code labels now win on a name collision** (§6.2), with a dev warning naming the shadowed sidecar label(s). Previously the editor sidecar's label silently overrode the code-authored one — the opposite of the decided rule that code labels are authoritative and the editor label is flagged for rename.
- ecdece8: `sync` timeline children are now properly opaque: a sync child that animates the same target as the parent (or another sync child) raises a `TimelineValidationError` instead of silently coalescing last-writer-wins. The previously-dead `opaque` flag becomes a load-bearing per-unit id in the compiler. `add` children still flatten and coalesce against the parent as before, and a sync child with disjoint targets still appears in `compiled.tracks` under its own target. Fixes a §2.3 nesting-model violation.

### Minor Changes

- 6c07c96: Motion-authoring sugar: **`springPresets`** — named spring feels (`default`, `gentle`, `wobbly`, `stiff`, `slow`, `molasses`, react-spring conventions) so you reach for a vocabulary instead of hand-tuning stiffness/damping: `spring(springPresets.wobbly)`, `springTo(t, a, b, springPresets.gentle)`. And **`stagger(tracks, delay)`** — cascade a list of tracks by shifting each one's key times (`delay` a per-index gap in seconds or a function of the index), the classic stagger for animating a list of nodes. Pure; the input tracks are untouched.

### Patch Changes

- 2282bcb: The downstream-friction batch (driven by a consuming project's 0.3.0→0.4.2 report). `createMeasurer({ fonts })` in backend-skia + `setDefaultMeasurer()` in scene bless factory-time measurement — Text pulls and un-injected scenes fall back through the process default before the estimator, so component factories measure with the rasterizer's real metrics (scene-injected measurers still win). `springTo(endT, from, to, cfg)` in core returns the [launch, settle] key pair with the spring-duration arithmetic done — settle-ON-the-beat without hand math. `Text.wordBoxes()` trims whitespace that punctuation-gluing folds into a segment (' $' → '$'), so boxes cover exactly the ink. `AudioClip.gain` accepts keys-only envelopes (`{ keys }`); the meaningless-but-mandatory target string is gone (full Tracks still work structurally). `duckEnvelope(timing, opts)` in narrate derives the music-bed ducking gain from the narration manifest (segment windows, attack/release ramps, near-window merging) — upstreamed from downstream. `gs render` progress detects non-TTY stderr and emits sparse newline-terminated updates instead of an unbroken \r stream.

### Minor Changes

- e89c3d0: The `path` value type + `Path` node (Lottie S0). `PathValue` is bezier contours in vertex form (`{closed, v, in, out}[]` — Lottie's own representation, plain JSON); morphs are pairwise lerps of anchors and tangents, exactly how lottie-web interpolates, with mismatched topology snapping (one-time dev warning) instead of interpolating garbage. `Path extends Shape` registers its geometry as the animatable `<id>/d` track target and emits cubic segments to the existing IR — zero backend work. Interact gains the §C.3 fill-rule hit test (flattened nonzero winding): a star misses in its notches, a reversed inner contour cuts a real hole. `inferValueType` sniffs `PathValue` so the builder works natively. Golden-pinned with an animated star↔blob morph; browser↔Skia parity on the paths corpus measured SSIM 1.00000.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 715be32: New package `@glissade/interact`: state machines over timelines (v2 addendum §A/§B). `StateMachineDoc` version 1 (sibling document, 'crossfade' reserved-not-valid), `createMachine` with typed inputs (boolean/number signals, queued triggers, loud unknown-name errors), one-transition-per-step semantics with exit-time windows, any-state edges, `onEnter` restart/resume, and `interruptible` queue-hold. Handoffs: cut / decay (with the Bollo overshoot clamp) / velocity-matched offset springs, type-class defaults, blend-from-frozen for lerp-only types, bounded one-offset re-interruption. `@glissade/player` gains `player.attach(machine)` with §A.1 target-disjointness validation; `@glissade/core` additionally exports `emitDevWarning`.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First public release.

  glissade is a TypeScript framework for programmatic motion graphics built on
  one contract: `evaluate(scene, timeline, t)` is a pure function of time. No
  generator functions — animations are serializable keyframe documents authored
  via a fluent builder or raw data.

  - Pull-based signals (lazy, cached, dependency-tracked) driving a
    renderer-agnostic scene graph with a flat DisplayList IR
  - Canvas 2D (browser) and Skia (headless CLI) backends with golden-frame CI:
    frames byte-compare across machines on a pinned toolchain — including text
    (explicit fonts) and flexbox layout (Yoga behind the LayoutEngine seam)
  - `gs render` CLI: PNG sequences or mp4/webm with mixed audio, encoder
    feature detection, video assets via FFmpeg extraction
  - In-browser export via WebCodecs + Mediabunny, faster than realtime, with
    sample-accurate OfflineAudioContext audio and bidirectional video scrub
  - Time-based Player with a Driver seam (rAF clock, scroll), `<gs-player>`
    custom element (~1 kB), React bindings
  - `bake()`: stateful simulation compiled to ordinary keyframe tracks
  - A React studio with draggable keyframes persisted to git-diffable sidecars
    that survive code edits
