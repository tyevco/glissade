# @glissade/scene

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- fbb12ca: Group filters (§3.4): `FilterSpec` is now a closed, validated union — `blur`, `drop-shadow`, `brightness`, `contrast`, `saturate` — never a CSS passthrough string. Nodes take `filters` as a prop (it's a signal, so a computed binding animates a blur radius from ordinary tracks), filtered subtrees composite as a unit, and both backends apply the compiled filter on the group's composite draw. Skia output is golden-pinned per filter; browser↔Skia parity measured at SSIM ≥ 0.9992 on the filters corpus — no per-filter exclusions needed.
- ab8ca37: Auto-sized Layout containers (§3.2): `width`/`height: 'auto'` size an axis from content via Yoga, and `layout.computedSize()` exposes the resolved size as a pure pull — bind a sibling to it (`height: () => panel.computedSize().h`) and backgrounds track content growth with no hand-synced tracks. Nested auto layouts report their computed `intrinsicSize`. The `LayoutEngine` seam's `compute` now takes `'auto'` axes and returns the resolved container size alongside the boxes; fixed axes keep spec-exact (unrounded) values, so existing layouts — including the byte-exact goldens — are untouched. `createScene` injects a live measurer reference into every node so derived-size bindings measure with the same rasterizer the flow uses.
- bc9add6: The shared `Raster2D` interpreter: one DisplayList command walk in `@glissade/scene`, generic over the host's canvas/path/drawable flavor. Both backends become thin adapters (context acquisition + a path constructor + a layer-canvas factory), so the twin rasterizers structurally cannot drift. Behavior-identical: every golden frame byte-matches through the refactor and the SSIM parity suite is unchanged. `Raster2D`, `fontString`, and the host interfaces are exported for future backends.
- e89c3d0: The `path` value type + `Path` node (Lottie S0). `PathValue` is bezier contours in vertex form (`{closed, v, in, out}[]` — Lottie's own representation, plain JSON); morphs are pairwise lerps of anchors and tangents, exactly how lottie-web interpolates, with mismatched topology snapping (one-time dev warning) instead of interpolating garbage. `Path extends Shape` registers its geometry as the animatable `<id>/d` track target and emits cubic segments to the existing IR — zero backend work. Interact gains the §C.3 fill-rule hit test (flattened nonzero winding): a star misses in its notches, a reversed inner contour cuts a real hole. `inferValueType` sniffs `PathValue` so the builder works natively. Golden-pinned with an animated star↔blob morph; browser↔Skia parity on the paths corpus measured SSIM 1.00000.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [e89c3d0]
  - @glissade/core@0.3.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- dcb28f2: Drivers, listeners, and hit testing (v2 addendum §C). `@glissade/player`: `Driver` generalizes to `InputDriver<T>` (the v1 alias is intact; `DriverContext.duration` is now optional) and `scrollDriver` writes normalized progress 0..1 in input mode. `@glissade/interact`: `pointerDriver` (rAF-coalesced, scene-scaled, optional driver-resident closed-form spring smoothing), `splitVec2` fan-out, `springFilter`, `createListeners` (hover/press/click → machine inputs, touch-emulated hover filtered), geometric `hitTest` (per-node-type shape tests on inverted cached world matrices, `hitArea` overrides, `interactiveChildren` pruning), and the separate `@glissade/interact/audio` entry with offline `audioAmplitudeTrack` (RMS or Goertzel band amplitude compiled to an ordinary Track). `@glissade/scene`: matrix `invert`, and nodes gain `interactive` / `interactiveChildren` / `hitArea`.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [715be32]
  - @glissade/core@0.2.0

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First public release.

  glissade is a TypeScript framework for programmatic motion graphics built on
  one contract: `evaluate(scene, timeline, t)` is a pure function of time. No
  generator functions — animations are serializable keyframe documents authored
  via a fluent builder or raw data.

  - Pull-based signals (lazy, cached, dependency-tracked) driving a
    renderer-agnostic scene graph with a flat DisplayList IR
  - Canvas 2D (browser) and Skia (headless CLI) backends with golden-frame CI:
    frames byte-compare across machines on a pinned toolchain — including text
    (explicit fonts) and flexbox layout (Yoga behind the LayoutEngine seam)
  - `gs render` CLI: PNG sequences or mp4/webm with mixed audio, encoder
    feature detection, video assets via FFmpeg extraction
  - In-browser export via WebCodecs + Mediabunny, faster than realtime, with
    sample-accurate OfflineAudioContext audio and bidirectional video scrub
  - Time-based Player with a Driver seam (rAF clock, scroll), `<gs-player>`
    custom element (~1 kB), React bindings
  - `bake()`: stateful simulation compiled to ordinary keyframe tracks
  - A React studio with draggable keyframes persisted to git-diffable sidecars
    that survive code edits
