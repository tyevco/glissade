**Gradient `Paint` — animatable linear & radial gradient fills.** `Paint` is now a core animatable document value (`{ kind: 'color' | 'linear' | 'radial' }`), and shape `fill` accepts a `Paint` as well as a color string. Gradients render as a fill with no offscreen composite and no filter — the cheap, soft-light alternative to a Gaussian blur (≈100× faster per frame in a soft-light-heavy scene). Geometry (`from`/`to`, `center`/`radius`) defaults to the shape's path bounds when omitted.

Gradients animate two ways: **signal-driven** (a computed `fill: () => ({ kind:'radial', center:[x(), y()], ... })` re-evaluates each frame) and **keyframe-driven** via the new `paint` value type — `tl.to('rect/fill', gradient, { ease })` interpolates stops (offset + oklab color) and geometry; a solid color lifts to a uniform gradient to meet a gradient; a mismatched kind/stop-count snaps with a dev warning. Deterministic and golden-byte-exact. Existing color fills are unchanged.
