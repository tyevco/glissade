The shared `Raster2D` interpreter: one DisplayList command walk in `@glissade/scene`, generic over the host's canvas/path/drawable flavor. Both backends become thin adapters (context acquisition + a path constructor + a layer-canvas factory), so the twin rasterizers structurally cannot drift. Behavior-identical: every golden frame byte-matches through the refactor and the SSIM parity suite is unchanged. `Raster2D`, `fontString`, and the host interfaces are exported for future backends.
