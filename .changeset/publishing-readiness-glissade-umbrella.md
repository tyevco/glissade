Publishing & release readiness: add per-package `engines.node >=20.19` to every publishable package, and introduce the unscoped `glissade` umbrella package — a one-import realtime embed surface that re-exports `@glissade/core`, `@glissade/scene`, and `@glissade/player` (and only those, per the §7.1 import direction). Also documents the `0.x` lockstep breaking-change policy in a root `BREAKING.md`.
