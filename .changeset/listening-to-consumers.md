The downstream-friction batch (driven by a consuming project's 0.3.0→0.4.2 report). `createMeasurer({ fonts })` in backend-skia + `setDefaultMeasurer()` in scene bless factory-time measurement — Text pulls and un-injected scenes fall back through the process default before the estimator, so component factories measure with the rasterizer's real metrics (scene-injected measurers still win). `springTo(endT, from, to, cfg)` in core returns the [launch, settle] key pair with the spring-duration arithmetic done — settle-ON-the-beat without hand math. `Text.wordBoxes()` trims whitespace that punctuation-gluing folds into a segment (' $' → '$'), so boxes cover exactly the ink. `AudioClip.gain` accepts keys-only envelopes (`{ keys }`); the meaningless-but-mandatory target string is gone (full Tracks still work structurally). `duckEnvelope(timing, opts)` in narrate derives the music-bed ducking gain from the narration manifest (segment windows, attack/release ramps, near-window merging) — upstreamed from downstream. `gs render` progress detects non-TTY stderr and emits sparse newline-terminated updates instead of an unbroken \r stream.
