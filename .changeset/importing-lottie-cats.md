New package `@glissade/lottie` + `gs import` (Lottie S1): an import-only, fail-fast Lottie/bodymovin converter. Shape, null, solid, and image layers; full transform mapping (anchor sandwiches, parent chains incl. hidden parents, ip/op visibility wrappers, ease-shift onto arrival keys, hold and same-frame rewrites, arc-length-baked spatial tangents); painter-model shape denormalization to Path nodes with animated path morphing; el/rc kappa conversion (exact under animation, direction-aware winding for nonzero holes); merge-paths mode 1. Everything outside the cut rejects in ONE error enumerating every problem (`--allow-degraded` downgrades expressions and exotic merge modes to warnings). Output is a plain SceneModule + v1 Timeline — render, studio, machines, and export consume it unchanged. Byte-deterministic across processes; never mutates its input.
