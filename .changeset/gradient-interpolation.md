Gradient `Paint` gains a per-gradient `interpolation` mode: `'linear'` (the canvas-native ramp, default — byte-identical), `'smooth'` (a smoothstep S-curve, no Mach-banding at stops), or `'gaussian'` (a soft gaussian shoulder that melts like a wide blur with 2–3 stops). `smooth`/`gaussian` densify and oklab-interpolate the stops at raster, so a soft-light fill reads as smooth as a Gaussian-blur filter with no offscreen composite. Deterministic + golden-byte-exact; `linear`/no-mode gradients are unchanged.
