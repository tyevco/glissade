`Text.wordBoxes()` — per-word ink boxes within each laid-out line, from the same segmentation the line breaker flows (Intl.Segmenter boundaries, punctuation glued to its word), positioned by cumulative prefix advances so cross-word kerning is exact and word widths sum to the line. The substrate for sub-line multi-color token highlights and word-synced karaoke (pair index-wise with a narration manifest's word timestamps). `segmentWords` is exported alongside `breakLines`.
