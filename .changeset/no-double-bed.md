Adoption-report follow-ups. TokenHighlight ranges gain an `offset` target (`'<id>/<rangeId>/offset'` + .x/.y) — per-range shakes and nudges without moving sibling ranges (downstream's red-flip shake previously had to jitter the whole node). `gs render` auto-mix never double-adds the bed: when the timeline's audio already references the stem (any url spelling resolving to the same file), the bed is skipped with a note — a coherent duplicate measured +6dB downstream. Docs: em-derived padding guidance for tokenHighlight at high resolutions; gainDb override (not compose) semantics pinned.
