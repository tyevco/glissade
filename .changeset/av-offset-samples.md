A/V sync offsets are now sample-accurate and identical across export paths by construction (§5.3). A new `audioOffsetSamples(at, sampleRate)` in core (`round(at * sampleRate)`) is the single source of truth: the CLI mixer derives its `adelay` from the sample grid instead of rounding to milliseconds, and the browser `OfflineAudioContext` mixer snaps clip starts (and gain-envelope times) to the same grid instead of using raw float seconds. Previously the two paths could drift sub-frame and a non-frame-aligned `at` passed through silently.
