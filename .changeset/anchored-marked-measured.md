Anchors, measured text, and marker highlights. `anchor` on any node with an intrinsic box pins `position` to a fraction of it (presets or `[ax, ay]`) and is the rotation/scale pivot (the Lottie model) — grow direction falls out: a 'left'-anchored width track sweeps rightward, `[0, 1]` grows bars upward. Unset keeps the legacy origin, byte-stable. `Text.measuredSize()` and `Text.lineBoxes()` expose the wrapped box and per-line ink boxes as pure pulls over the same line-break pass that draws — no hand-calculated text dimensions. `highlight(text, opts)` sweeps per-line rounded marker rects via one 0→1 `progress` track (reading order, width-weighted constant speed, multiply-blend ink, line count fully dynamic); key progress from narration word timestamps for karaoke. Hit testing distinguishes draw-space boxes (`drawOffset`) from flow placement (`flowOffset`), so anchored nodes hit exactly where they draw, including rotation around the pivot.
