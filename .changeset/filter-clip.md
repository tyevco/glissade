'@glissade/scene': patch

Filtered group composites now clip to the layer's painted bounds plus the filter's reach. Canvas `ctx.filter` cost scales with the destination area, so a small glowing node was paying for full-canvas gaussians every frame on software-rendered (no-GPU) browsers — measured 16× faster on the isolated composite and ~3.4× on the filter-heavy showcase scene. Pixel-invisible by construction: conservative device-space bounds (miter-aware strokes, measured text), 3×radius gaussian reach, color-only filters map transparent→transparent; non-source-over blends and shader layers never clip. Golden suite unchanged byte-for-byte.
