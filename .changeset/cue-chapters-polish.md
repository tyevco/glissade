Cue→chapters polish (downstream validation follow-ups on the 0.8 ad-break feature):

- **Plain `cue()` now serializes.** `cue(at, name, data?)` stamps `data.kind: 'cue'` by default (a caller-supplied `kind` still wins), so a cue authored without an explicit kind now lands in `cues.json` and fires `player.onCue('cue', …)` instead of being silently dropped. The `data.kind` gate that excludes `.call()`/label markers stays intact.
- **`--chapters vtt` shows the human title, not the kind.** The WebVTT cue text is now `data.title ?? name` (was the machine `kind`), and a `00:00` "Intro" chapter is auto-anchored when the earliest cue starts later — making the output a drop-in for a YouTube description chapter block (YouTube reads the cue text as the title and requires a 0:00 start). `cues.json` is unchanged (keeps `kind` for machines) and stays byte-deterministic.
